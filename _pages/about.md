I’m a postdoctoral scholar at Johns Hopkins University developing general mathematical frameworks for structured ecological and epidemiological systems.

My current work formalizes **trait-resolved functionals** — model-agnostic spectral metrics capturing invasion, persistence, and recovery — and connects them to field-relevant dynamics in marine systems, infectious disease, and cultural evolution.

## Spectral Coexistence Theory

**Spectral Coexistence Theory I** *(Preprint forthcoming)*  
Defines a class of trait-resolved functionals—invasion, persistence, resilience—derived from the spectral properties of trait-indexed dynamical systems. Establishes a model-agnostic operator-theoretic foundation for structured population modeling across ODEs, PDEs, DDEs, and maps.

- Examples drawn from trait-structured chemostat models
- Includes simplex visualizations, symbolic and numerical results, and estimation pipelines
- Forms the theoretical foundation for ongoing work across biological and social systems

## Applied Systems

### **Plankton Dynamics and Trait Thresholds**  
[Journal of Mathematical Biology (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-023-01969-7)  
Analyzes Hopf bifurcation and hysteresis in an NPZD model with seasonal forcing and nonlinear feedback. Serves as a motivating example for the development of trait-based spectral functionals in later work.

### **FMDV Transmission in African Buffalo**  
[The American Naturalist (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1086/730703)  
Links viral growth rates and immune responses to trait-mediated transmission outcomes. Shows how structured within-host dynamics shape landscape-scale epidemic thresholds.

### **Sequential Dengue Infections and ADE**  
[BioRxiv Preprint (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.29.555313v1)  
Explores antibody-dependent enhancement using a viral-immune kinetics model. Parameter recovery pipelines inform trade-offs and uncertainty in trait structure.

### **Cultural Transmission and Network Clustering**  
[Evolutionary Human Sciences (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2024.45)  
Analyzes cultural data from Austronesian-speaking groups. Principal component structure and trait clustering interpreted through trait-functional geometry.

[arXiv Preprint: Bayesian Estimation of the Number of Significant Principal Components for Cultural Data (2024)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.12129)  
Develops a probabilistic framework for identifying latent structure in cultural datasets, enabling principled dimensionality reduction prior to trait-functional recovery.

### **Behavioral Heterogeneity in COVID-19 Transmission**  
[Royal Society Open Science (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210227)  
Models population-level persistence under variable lockdown fatigue, testing access, and behavioral adherence across U.S. states.

[Journal of Theoretical Biology (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110919)  
Analyzes reactive quarantine policies during early outbreaks in China using a compartmental COVID model with behavior-structured feedback.

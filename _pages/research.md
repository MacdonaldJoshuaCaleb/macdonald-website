## Spectral Coexistence Theory

**Spectral Coexistence Theory I** *(Preprint forthcoming)*  
Defines a class of trait-resolved functionals—invasion, persistence, resilience—derived from the spectral properties of trait-indexed dynamical systems. Establishes a model-agnostic operator-theoretic foundation for structured population modeling across ODEs, PDEs, DDEs, and maps.

- Examples drawn from trait-structured chemostat models
- Includes simplex visualizations, symbolic and numerical results, and estimation pipelines
- Forms the theoretical foundation for ongoing work across biological and social systems

## Applied Systems

### **Plankton Dynamics and Trait Thresholds**  
*In preparation* — Applies spectral functionals to NPZD models with seasonal forcing and feedback. Demonstrates how trait resilience and bloom thresholds emerge from dynamical sorting.

### **FMDV Transmission in African Buffalo**  
[The American Naturalist (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1086/730703)  
Links viral growth rates and immune responses to trait-mediated transmission outcomes. Shows how structured within-host dynamics shape landscape-scale epidemic thresholds.

### **Sequential Dengue Infections and ADE**  
[BioRxiv Preprint (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.29.555313v1)  
Explores antibody-dependent enhancement using a viral-immune kinetics model. Parameter recovery pipelines inform trade-offs and uncertainty in trait structure.

### **Cultural Transmission and Network Clustering**  
[Evolutionary Human Sciences (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2024.45)  
Analyzes cultural data from Austronesian-speaking groups. Principal component structure and trait clustering interpreted through trait-functional geometry.

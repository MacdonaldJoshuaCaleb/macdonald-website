I develop mathematical tools for **dynamical and statistical modeling** of structured populations—systems in which individuals, agents, or processes vary across continuous or discrete traits.

My current work **defines and formalizes trait-resolved functionals**—real-valued mappings derived from the spectral properties of trait-indexed dynamical systems. These functionals generalize concepts like invasion fitness, persistence thresholds, and resilience, but are constructed in a **model-agnostic, operator-theoretic framework** that applies across ODEs, PDEs, delay systems, and discrete-time models.

The forthcoming preprint, *Spectral Coexistence Theory I*, introduces this framework and demonstrates its application to a family of trait-structured chemostat models. These examples illustrate how trait functionals can be computed, visualized, and recovered from simulated data.

This theory is informed by prior modeling work on:

- Phytoplankton bloom dynamics (NPZD)
- Trait-mediated host–pathogen systems (FMDV)
- Immune feedback and sequential infection (DENV)
- Cultural transmission networks (Austronesian expansion)

Ongoing collaborations at Johns Hopkins, WHOI, Oregon State and IOLR are helping extend these ideas into **empirically grounded recovery pipelines and statistical inference workflows** for structured population systems.
